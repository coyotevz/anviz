## Anviz

Driver to communicate with Anviz Time & Attendance device writen in Python.

The implementation is based on [CommsProtocol](https://github.com/benperiton/anviz-protocol/raw/master/Docs/CommsProtocol.pdf). Not fully implemented.

By the moment tested with Anviz A300 model, but must work for other models too.

Pull Request are welcome.
